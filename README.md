# Dungeon Delve

The dim corridors wind aimlessly, looping upon themselves. You wonder when someone last set foot here.<br>
Will you see your way through the entire dungeon, finding every key needed to leave?

* WASD or arrow keys to move
* Left-Shift to sprint
* Left-click to drop a breadcrumb
* E to pick up breadcrumbs in front of you
* Walk over a key to pick it up
* *Collect all keys to clear the dungeon!*

Art assets are my own.<br>
First person controller is from Unity Standard Assets.<br>
Dungeon generator and game code are my own.<br>
